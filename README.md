# ForensicLens

![ForensicLens logo](forensiclens_logo.png)

**ForensicLens** is a powerful, terminal-based forensic image analysis tool designed to detect tampering, verify integrity, and extract detailed insights from digital images. Built with Python, it leverages advanced techniques like PRNU analysis, machine learning, and frequency domain analysis to assist forensic investigators, researchers, and enthusiasts.

## Features

- **Basic Metadata Extraction**: File size, format, dimensions, and mode.
- **Perceptual Hashing**: Generates a hash for integrity checking and similarity comparison.
- **Pixel Analysis**: Computes average RGB values for basic color profiling.
- **Histogram Analysis**: Plots RGB histograms to detect anomalies (saved as `histogram.png`).
- **Edge Detection**: Applies Canny edge detection to highlight potential edits (saved as `edges.png`).
- **Error Level Analysis (ELA)**: Identifies compression inconsistencies (saved as `ela.png`).
- **Noise Analysis**: Estimates noise levels to spot tampering (saved as `noise.png`).
- **Metadata Tampering Detection**: Checks EXIF data for inconsistencies (e.g., future dates).
- **Frequency Domain Analysis (FFT)**: Detects periodic noise or resampling artifacts (saved as `fft_spectrum.png`).
- **Block Artifact Analysis**: Identifies JPEG compression blocks that may indicate edits (saved as `block_artifacts.png`).
- **PRNU Analysis**: Extracts camera-specific noise patterns for source identification (saved as `prnu.png`).
- **Machine Learning-Based Tampering Detection**: Uses an SVM classifier to predict tampering probability (requires training).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/makalin/ForensicLens.git
   cd ForensicLens
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or manually install:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow imagehash numpy opencv-python matplotlib scipy scikit-learn joblib
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**:
   Test with a sample image:
   ```bash
   python forensiclens.py sample.jpg
   ```

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.6 or higher
- **Libraries**: 
  - `Pillow`: Image processing
  - `imagehash`: Perceptual hashing
  - `numpy`: Numerical computations
  - `opencv-python`: Image analysis (e.g., edge detection)
  - `matplotlib`: Plotting (e.g., histograms)
  - `scipy`: Signal processing (e.g., FFT, Wiener filter)
  - `scikit-learn`: Machine learning (SVM)
  - `joblib`: Model persistence

Create a `requirements.txt` file with:
```
Pillow
imagehash
numpy
opencv-python
matplotlib
scipy
scikit-learn
joblib
```

## Usage

Run the tool from the terminal by providing an image path:
```bash
python forensiclens.py path/to/image.jpg
```

## Notes

- **PRNU Analysis**: This is a simplified implementation. For accurate camera source identification, calibrate with multiple images from the same device.
- **ML Tampering Detection**: The included SVM model is a placeholder. For production use, train it with a labeled dataset (e.g., CASIA Tampered Image Detection Dataset) and update `scaler.pkl` and `svm_model.pkl`.
- **Performance**: Large images may take longer to process, especially for FFT and ML features.
